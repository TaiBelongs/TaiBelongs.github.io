# Hello!

My name is Tai (he/him).

I am passionate about sense of belonging research in education and higher education contexts, and extremely motivated to support students from systematically marginalized and disenfranchised backgrounds (e.g., first-generation, low-income, students of color, and holding immigrant or refugee status).

I am a current PhD Candidate within the Psychological Foundations of Education Program in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.Â \
\
I am a mixed- and multi-methods researcher, with knowledge at the intersections of social psychology, education, and educational and psychological measurement.

I am a 1.5 generation Vietnamese American immigrant from low-income background, and who is also the first in his family to attend college.

If you are interested in collaborating with me on any projects, and/or just talking, please definitely reach out!
