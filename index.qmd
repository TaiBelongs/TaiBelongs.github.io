## Hello! {style="color: green"}

My name is Tai (he/him).

I am passionate about sense of belonging research in education and higher education contexts, and extremely motivated to support students from systematically marginalized and disenfranchised backgrounds (e.g., first-generation, low-income, students of color, and holding immigrant or refugee status).

If you are interested in collaborating with me on any projects, and/or just talking, please definitely reach out using the links at the end of this page.

Please check out my most recent article here: <https://openjournals.libs.uga.edu/jheoe/article/view/3317/2950>
