    "text": "My purpose for this page is share the courses that I have taught either as instructor of record, teaching assistant, or guest lecturer.\n\n\nThis course examines contemporary and historical perspectives on issues of social and cultural diversity in the United States, with special emphasis on issues of race, ethnicity, gender, social class, ability, sexual orientation, and religious diversity. Processes of oppression, stereotyping, prejudice, and social perception biases are the primary topics of the course. The course develops a context in which participants develop insights in the personal nature of prejudice while they study the propagation of prejudice in school culture and social structures. The insights of how and why prejudices develop help participants to understand their interactions with “diverse” others and form competencies and sensitivities related to multicultural issues of diversity. The course presents models for personal and educational change that confront issues of racism, sexism, homophobia, and disability insensitivity.\nCourse Goals, Objectives, and Expectations\n\nDevelop an awareness of multicultural issues in educational settings.\nIdentify how aspects of culture influence their daily lives.\nUse critical thinking skills to examine how power and privilege affect their lives and society at large. \nBe able to identify and implement strategies for reducing bias and affirming diverse cultures in the classroom and everyday life. \nBe able to consider complex multicultural topics from both an educational, cultural, and psychological lens.\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes\n\nCan locate and critically evaluate information\nUnderstand diverse philosophies and cultures within and across societies\nUnderstand psychological, educational, and cultural mechanisms in student experiences and learning\nUnderstand ways to assess, evaluate, and measure student learning and education with respect to cross-cultural goals\n\n\n\n\nIn this course you will learn about: Theories of child development and how they relate to approaches to instruction; Behaviorist, cognitive, and social cognitive learning theories; Approaches to instruction and assessment (teacher-centered vs. student-centered vs. assessment-centered); and Issues related to assessment and measuring student learning (validity, reliability, interpretation, etc.) by participating in assessment design (traditional, performance, formative) and interpretation.\n\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn how to design and enact research projects related to teaching and learning in K-12 schools.  The course content will cover theories of learning, cognition, and development and will focus on how these theories explain how students learn and inform teaching practices.  The course will feature guest lectures from university faculty from multiple departments and centers including The Center for Applied Research and Development, The Department of Curriculum and Instruction and the Department of Educational Psychology.\n\n\n\nIn this course, we will examine theories of intelligence and creativity, their development, and their implications for educational practices and psychological research. This course is part of the certification program in gifted education and talented education. \n\n\n\nThis course will provide an overview of the study of the gifted and talented and their education. Among those topics are cognitive and affective characteristics of gifted and talented students, the identification of gifted and talented, curricular and instructional issues, and parental and social relationships. This course should interest graduate and undergraduate students as well as educators, counselors, and other interested parties who want to learn about the gifted and talented and their education. In this course, we will examine theories of giftedness, talent development, instructional strategies, diversity and technological issues, implications for educational practices and psychological inquiry, and international considerations."

In particular, Tai is interested in sense of belonging and the intrapsychic and interpersonal processes that elicit and facilitate college students’ feelings of belonging. His research, teaching, and mentorship are aimed at supporting future student-scholars from intersectional and underserved backgrounds, including but not limited to, students from low-income, first-generation, and/or underrepresented race/ethnic backgrounds.\nTo read more about me, please visit these links:\n\nhttps://news.cehd.umn.edu/tai-do-phd-student-awarded-cehd-gage-dissertation-completion-fellowship/\nhttps://news.cehd.umn.edu/tai-do-phd-student-honored-with-universitys-pslsa-cehds-outstanding-student-service-award/\n\n\n** Note: I receive my education from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
